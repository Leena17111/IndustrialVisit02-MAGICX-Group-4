Although I didnâ€™t personally attend the visit to MaGICX, learning about it from my peers was truly inspiring. I was particularly impressed by their use of VR and AR to enhance learning and training, making them more engaging and effective. Hearing about tools like the Bicycle Simulator and Oculus VR headset sparked my interest in immersive technologies and their potential to transform industries, and human life. This insight has motivated me to explore game development and AR/VR technologies as promising fields for future innovation. I plan one day to personally visit MaGICX and try out their games and learn more about how they develop them !
